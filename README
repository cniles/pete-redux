Build
=====
To create the necessary build files for your development environment, you will
need CMake.

You will also need the following development libraries downloaded and
configured on your system:

-SDL	      	Cross-platform windowing and input.
-SDL_image	Loading of additional image formats
-freetype2	Loading & rendering fonts
-GLEW:		OpenGL extensions
-Bullet3D:	Physics

If you are on linux, everything above should be available from your package
manager except for Bullet3D.  You can get to their installation files from

www.bulletphysics.org

Once all the necessary libraries are properly installed, from the games root
directory execute:

For Linux
=========
> cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
> make

And to run:

> ./pete

For Windows
===========
From the games root directory, run:

> cmake -G <visual studio version>

You can get a list of the cmake build generator arguments available for your
platform with cmake's help option:

> cmake -h

As an alternative to the command line tool, CMake also includes a GUI
interface.

Finally, open the generatred AllBuild Visual Studio project to build and run
the game.
